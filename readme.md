Problem Statement - In the above URL, Titles released in 2018 are listed sorted by the number of votes. Your job is to create a scraper that will go over the titles between a given range T1=1000 and T2=8000 where T1 and T2 are Title Serial Number and print the one Title name with the maximum runtime.

For Example -

If The Range is : T1=1, T2=5

Expected Output :Avengers: Infinity War 149

Submission Process (READ THIS CAREFULLY):

You donâ€™t need to submit the scraping script. Just print the output to the console. That means for the sample test case given above, your submission would look like
print("Avengers: Infinity War 149")
Your final submission should contain the result for ranges T1=1000 and T2=8000
If you get selected, the scraping code and approach would be discussed in the interview call.
